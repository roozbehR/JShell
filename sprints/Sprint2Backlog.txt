User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user I should be able to convert multiple lines of text to speech at the same time 
b) As a user I should be able to enter special keyword to end transcription 
c) As a user I should be able to create new directory with respect to absoloute path in existing location 
d) As a user I should be able to change current working directory to another directory with respect to current directory 
e) As a user I should be able to view the contents of multiple directories at once to see what exist in all of them 
f) As a user I should be able to view entire subtrees of directories to see which are files and and which are directories 
g) As a user I should be able to view contents of an arbitrary number of files at once to check file content
h) As a user I should be able to output string into output file to save text in the file 
i) As a user I should be able to send output string into output file to add it to the file 
j) As a user I should be able to view feedback from the shell when commands are not completed successfully to know when operations have not been carried out
k) As a user I should be able to view feedback from the shell when invalid commands are entered to know when I did things wrong
l) As a user I should be able to parse user input through an interpreter
m) As a user I should be able to change to the most recent saved directory while removing them from the stack of saved directories to maintain proper flow of saved directories
