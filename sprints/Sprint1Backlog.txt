17th June (12:01 am) to 23rd June (11:59 pm)


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user I should be able to prompt for user input
b) As a user I should be able to parse user input through an interpreter
c) As a user I should be notified of entering invalid/non-existent commands to know when nothing has happened
d) As a user I should be able to view feedback from the shell when commands are not completed successfully to know when operations have not been carried out
e) As a user I should be able to view feedback from the shell when invalid commands are entered to know when I did things wrong
f) As a user I should be able to terminate the program
g) As a user I should be able to see an ordered list of previous inputs to see what work has been done so far
h) As a user I should be able to convert string to audible speech
i) As a user I should be able to view the current working directory to see the path I am operating with respect to
j) As a user I should be able to view contents of an arbitrary number of files at once to check file content
k) As a user I should be able to should be able to create new directory with respect to current working directory
l) As a user I should be able to change current working directory to another directory with respect to absolute path
m) As a user I should be able to save current working directory while changing to new directory in case I want to come back to it later
n) As a user I should be able to change to the most recent saved directory while removing them from the stack of saved directories to maintain proper flow of saved directories
o) As a user I should be able to see the contents of the current directory to check what files or directories exist within it
p) As a user I should be able to see documentation of each command to see how it works
q) As a user I should be able to output string into shell to see how input text is interpreted
